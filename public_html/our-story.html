            Justin and Sydney met in Theology class their freshmen year of college,
            but she didn't remember him from that. They grew to know each other better
            through a mutual friend their sophomore year. Justin had thought he
            should take a break from dating since he hadn't had much luck that year,
            but God had other plans for him. As Justin and Sydney got to know each
            other better, Justin couldn't help wanting to spend more and more time
            with the beautiful woman God had placed in his life. After much time
            spent in prayer and discernment, Justin decided to place his faith in
            God's voice and take a risk with Sydney. He asked her out at one of the
            ornate fountains on Benedictine College's campus. It did not take long
            for the two of them to decide they wanted to get married. After an
            evening of ring shopping one Christmas break, Justin finally had the
            idea of the perfect ring to get Sydney. Unbeknownst to Sydney, Justin finally
            bought the ring and asked her father if he could marry her later that summmer. 
            Much to Sydney's surprise, he proposed to her on a walk down by the Missouri 
            River on September 1<sup>st</sup>, 2024. Now, they are set to be married on August 
            9<sup>th</sup>, 2025. Be sure not to miss it!
